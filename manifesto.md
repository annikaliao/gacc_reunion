> Through our own experience and that of others, we are learning more effective ways to create software. We've developed a sense of value for this job, and strive to have: 
- **Interaction and collaboration** with each other
- **High-quality, functional code** to ensure our best product
- **Clear communication of group deadlines** to stay on top of things 
- **Everyone's best interest!**
